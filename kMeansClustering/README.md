- Overall goal is to divide data into distinct groups such that observations within each group are similar 
- Choose k clusters
- Unsupervised algorithm 
- Algorithm randomly assigns each observation to a cluster, finds the centroid of each cluster
- Next step is to reassign each data point to the closest centroid
- Affter that, calaculate the new centroid of each cluster
- Repeat until cluster variation cant be reduced
