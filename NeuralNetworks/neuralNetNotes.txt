Artificial Neural Networks
- modeled after biological neurons
- learn thru reinforcement 
- can be used for pattern recognition, time series recognition, signal processing, anomaly detection

TensorFlow
- open source software library developed by Google
- most popular Deep Learning library in the field 
- typically deep learning NN run faster on GPU
- allow you to create data flow graphs 
- graphs have nodes and edges 
- arrays (data) passed along from layer of nodes to layer to layer of nodes is known as a Tensor
- two ways to use it 
	1) customizable graph session 
	2) Scikit-Learn type interface w/ Contrib.Learn 
- Session method very
