- Used for classification and regression analysis
- Examples as points in space
- Form hyperplane(s) to separate classes that will maximize margins between classes
- Points that touch the hyperplane margin line are called support vectors
- Does not have to be linearly separable. We can use the "kernel trick" and view non-linear data by using 3+d models
